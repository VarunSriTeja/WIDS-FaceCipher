# WIDS-FaceCipher
Welcome folks to the Winter in Data Science Project - FaceCipher. We will begin from scratch and move on step by step.The content will be posted week by week here.
## **Week 1** 
We will begin with a brief revision of Python fundamentals to ensure everyone is on the same page. Then, we will introduce essential tools for data manipulation and visualization, setting up an efficient workflow using popular Python libraries. Foundational ML concepts, such as Linear and Logistic Regression, will lay the groundwork for predictive modeling and classification.
